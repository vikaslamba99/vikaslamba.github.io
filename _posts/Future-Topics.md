Kalman gain
Fusing multiple estimates
The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are heuristic approaches to using Kalman filtering for nonlinear systems.
UKF. When the system dynamics and observation models are highly nonlinear, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) can be an improvement over the EKF. The UKF is based on the unscented transformation, which is a method for computing the statistics of a random variable x that undergoes a nonlinear transformation (y = ะด(x)). The random variable x is sampled using a carefully chosen set of sigma points and these sample points are propagated through the nonlinear function ะด. The UKF tends to be more robust and accurate than the EKF but has higher computation overhead due to the sampling process.
