Quantitative Algorithmic trading is the computerised execution of the financialinstruments following the trading strategies that are developed using advancedmathematical models. Quantitative methods are used for carrying out theresearch, analysing the historical data and using the complex mathematical andstatistical models to find the trading opportunities that are profitable.

The algorithm, using the quantitative models, decides on various importantaspects of the trade such as the price, timing, and quantity, and executes thetrade automatically without human intervention. The algorithmic tradingprocess involves making use of powerful computers to run these complexmathematical models and execute the trade orders.

This involves automating the full process including order generation,submission, and the order execution and provides investors with more efficientexecutions while lowering transaction costs and the resultis, improved portfolio performance.

The benefits compared to traditional trading include (among many others):
  1. Higher effi ciency
  2. Lower commissions
  3. Anonymity
  4. Reduced market impact
  5. More Control over the orders
  6. Minimum Information Leakage
  7. Transparency surrounding the order execution for the money manager or investor
  8. Reduced transaction costs

The mere adoption of algorithmic trading alone does not guarantee betterresults. It is imperative that the underlying strategy is proactive, robust andextremely well back-tested.

A quantitative algorithmic trading engine will need many robust parts workinghand in hand, but at the same time each of them applying their ownquantitative techniques. Some of the key elements required are:
  1. Investable Universe identifi cation
  2. Generic Momentum information
  3. Clear Momentum Quality identifi cation
  4. Momentum seasonality
  5. Investing with conviction and in time
  6. Exhaustive and un-biased backtesting

One can never over stress the importance of rigorous back-testing, free fromany bias, intentional or un-intentional. Back-testing is a popular way toexamine the performance of a quantitative trading strategy. It simulates tradesof assets utilising historical data of the assets and any other additionalinformation if necessary. One important assumption here is that we could havebought and sold the assets at the realised prices in the past such as daily closingprices, even though this might not have been the case in reality.

A word of caution here is that a high performance in back-testing does in noway guarantee the same results in future. Back-testing is a kind of backward-looking methodology by its very nature and there is no guarantee that the futuremarket will behave like the past. Despite this, the back-testing can still give usenough useful information to understand why one strategy works well and theother doesn’t depending on various market situations which occurred inhistory.

Below is a graph showing the results of an overlapping momentum strategy,where the returns on a portfolio comprising of a maximum of 10 assets at anypoint are compared to benchmark performance for S&P 100 index, over aperiod of 4 years from Feb, 2016 to Jan, 2020. The performance of the assets istracked monthly and, where required, leads to portfolio turnover. Although, itappears that the strategy was quite effective and provided a decent return ofover 200% over the tenure but still, apart from other factors that need to bereviewed, including maximum drawdown and the Sharpe ratio, the 4 yearsperiod for back-testing is quite small.

Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) documented how strategies of buying recent stockwinners and selling recent losers generated significantly higher near-termreturns than the market. But, the above strategy presented as example haspurely taken long position on the momentum stocks.

We know that momentum exists, but why should such a strongreturn pattern such as momentum persist?

As an investment strategy, it stands almost in complete denial of, the “efficientmarket hypothesis” (EMH), one of the central tenets of modern finance. Anatural possibility is investor misreaction due to behavioural biases. Jegadeeshand Titman (2011) also suggest that momentum profits arise because of adelayed reaction to firm specific information.

EMH, of course, is the argument that has made index (or “passive”) stockinvesting so incredibly popular over the last 25 years: You can’t outsmart themarket, so just own the whole thing. Yet various styles of momentum investingcontinue to reward their investor practitioners with above-average returns.

Why is quantitative trading becoming increasingly important?

The combination of the behavioural bias and market frictions constantly resultsin mispriced assets. This arbitrage can often be short lived and if not takenadvantage of in short space of time, it is simply opportunity lost. And sincehumans are flawed decision makers under duress, the trading job is bestperformed by algorithms that are trained using deep learning and gargantuansets of data.

The race to higher alpha in most firms often boils down to getting hands on thenext valuable source of data. There is a lot of tactical asset allocation alpha toderive from macro-economic and price-volume data. This is exactly why mostquantitative fund managers believe that data science is the only way to build agreat portfolio management firm today. But building a data science firm needs asizable investment. Most of the investments are front loaded and cannot bedeferred to a time when the fund has raised hundreds of millions of dollarsalready. Hence an institutional investor needs to think like a venture capitalfirm and be prepared to invest in the GP of promising managers.

As we have seen, for Investment Management industry, the recent years havebeen full of A.I. advancements, stronger ‘deep learning’ adoption in finance,higher initial setup costs as well as fresh market challenges.
